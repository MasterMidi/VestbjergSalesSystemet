# VestbjergSalesSystemet

### Description
The project was develop for our first semester project, to be used in our first year exam, studing computer science at UCN Aalborg, Denmark.
The project is designed using 3-layer architecture, and is using a tui, however it will be updated to implement a gui.

The project is followed up in a report, where we first analysed the buisness we were developing the system for, essistially creating a buisness case.
We've also created UML diagrams, to design and document our code.

It is worth mentioning, that this isn't a fully develop system. It's a one use-case system, out of many.
This is primary due to the timeframe which we had to design, document and develop the system.
